The Game of Life made in java

Takes the game of life rules  
1. Underpoulation - any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies
2. Sustaining - any live cell with two or three more neighbours contiues to live
3. Overpopulation -any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
4. Reproduction - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell

This program takes these rules and simulates a board of cells with them, randomizing the starting cells each time
